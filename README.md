# Stone-tools-js
Stone tools is a collection of reusable, pure functions intended as a personal tool package by its creator. Its name is inspired by this quote by Stanford professor Donald Knuth:

"People think that computer science is the art of geniuses, but the actual reality is the opposite, just many people doing things that build on each other, like a wall of mini stones"

The creator of Stone-tools intends to grow this library as he matures as a developer, as well as create a similar library for each language he learns.
